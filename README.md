# Multi Project Harness

* This is a proposal for handling multiple projects in the user project area of the [Caravel harness](https://github.com/efabless/caravel)
* This is a fork of caravel with https://github.com/mattvenn/multi-project-harness added to /verilog/rtl/
* user_project_wrapper is then adjusted to instantiate https://github.com/mattvenn/multi-project-harness/blob/main/multi_project_harness.v
